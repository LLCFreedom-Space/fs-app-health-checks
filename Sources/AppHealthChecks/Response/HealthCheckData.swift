/// The `checks` object MAY have a number of unique keys, one for each logical downstream dependency or sub-component.
/// Since each sub-component may be backed by several nodes with varying health statuses, these keys point to arrays of objects.
/// In case of a single-node sub-component (or if presence of nodes is not relevant), a single-element array SHOULD be used as the value, for consistency.
/// The key identifying an element in the object SHOULD be a unique string within the details section. 
/// It MAY have two parts: `{componentName}:{measurementName}`, in which case the meaning of the parts SHOULD be as follows:
public struct HealthCheckData: Content {
    ///Is a unique identifier of an instance of a specific sub-component/dependency of a service.
    ///Multiple objects with the same componentID MAY appear in the details, if they are from different nodes
    public var componentId: String?
    /// SHOULD be present if componentName is present. It's a type of the component and could be one of:
    public var componentType: ComponentType?
    /// Could be any valid JSON value, such as: string, number, object, array or literal
    public var observedValue: Double?
    /// SHOULD be present if observedValue is present. 
    /// Clarifies the unit of measurement in which observedUnit is reported, e.g. for a time-based value it is important to know whether the time is reported in seconds, minutes, hours or something else.
    /// To make sure unit is denoted by a well-understood name or an abbreviation, it SHOULD be one of:
    public var observedUnit: String?
    /// Has the exact same meaning as the top-level "output" element, but for the sub-component/downstream dependency represented by the details object
    public var status: HealthCheckStatus?
    /// Is a JSON array containing URI Templates as defined by [RFC6570]. This field SHOULD be omitted if the `status` field is present and has value equal to "pass".
    /// A typical API has many URI endpoints. Most of the time we are interested in the overall health of the API, without diving into details.
    /// That said, sometimes operational and resilience middleware needs to know more details about the health of the API (which is why `checks` property provides details).
    /// In such cases, we often need to indicate which particular endpoints are affected by a particular check's troubles vs. other endpoints that may be fine
    public var affectedEndpoints: [String]?
    /// Is the date-time, in ISO8601 format, at which the reading of the observedValue was recorded.
    /// This assumes that the value can be cached and the reading typically doesn't happen in real time, for performance and scalability purposes
    public var time: String?
    /// Has the exact same meaning as the top-level `output` element, but for the sub-component/downstream dependency represented by the details object.
    ///  As is the case for the top-level element, this field SHOULD be omitted for "pass" state of a downstream dependency
    public var output: String?
    /// Has the exact same meaning as the top-level `output` element, but for the sub-component/downstream dependency represented by the details object
    public var links: [String: String]?
    /// Number of node
    public var node: Int?
