    /// Indicates whether the service status is acceptable or not. API publishers SHOULD use following values for the field:
    /// `pass`: healthy (acceptable aliases: `ok` to support Node's Terminus and `up` for Java's SpringBoot),
    /// `fail`: unhealthy (acceptable aliases: `error` to support Node's Terminus and `down` for Java's SpringBoot), and
    /// `warn`: healthy, with some concerns.
    /// The value of the status field is case-insensitive and is tightly related with the HTTP response code returned by the health endpoint.
    /// For `pass` status, HTTP response code in the 2xx-3xx range MUST be used. For "fail" status, HTTP response code in the 4xx-5xx range MUST be used.
    /// In case of the `warn` status, endpoints MUST return HTTP status in the 2xx-3xx range, and additional information SHOULD be provided, utilizing optional fields of the response.
    /// A health endpoint is only meaningful in the context of the component it indicates the health of.
    /// It has no other meaning or purpose. As such, its health is a conduit to the health of the component.
    /// Clients SHOULD assume that the HTTP response code returned by the health endpoint is applicable to the entire component (e.g. a larger API or a microservice).
    ///  This is compatible with the behavior that current infrastructural tooling expects: load-balancers, service discoveries and others, utilizing health-checks.
